# ExpenseTracker

The main View features a chart that tracks this monthâ€™s spending as of date. By dragging the chart line, it is possible to see the history of 
total spending per specific day.

The main view also displays the most recent five transactions. By tapping the "See All" button it's possible to see all transactions sectioned in months.
Each transaction details the merchant, category, date, and amount. Debited amounts are colored and have a "+" sign. Icons from SwiftUIFontIcon
are used on this project for categories. 

The app also supports dark mode.
